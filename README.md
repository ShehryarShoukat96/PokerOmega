## PokerOmega:
A self-learning multi-agent poker player, a la AlphaGo. It learns but doesn't work too hot, probably because of insufficient training time/resources.

## Notes:
* USE A VIRTUALENV (`virtualenvwrapper` is great). **Python 3**
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and don't forget to add your required modules in there as well
* `git push/pull` often
* Work on your own branches, make pull requests to master
